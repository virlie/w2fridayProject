Installation

Specification:
  User needs to be able to see what they typed in
      Example input: 2350435
      Example output:2350435

  Program needs to evaluate whether the input was a number or not a number.
      Example input: adff
      Example output: alert error message.

  If user had input a number divisible by 3, program will show message: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
      Example input: 9
      Example output: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

  If user had input a number a 1, and not divisible by 3, program will show a message that will say: "Boop".
      Example input: 10
      Example output:"Boop"

  If user had input a number 0, and not divisible by 3, program will show a message that will say: "Beep".
      Example input: 0
      Example output:"Beep"











Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program the number 10 should be replaced with "Boop!", and the number 30 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
